### Session 0

Undocumented, no data.

### Session 1

I had an after-midnight session today. I originally began to play this yesterday, but had to uninstall and reinstall it to reset my progress. It was very difficult as the play store was corrupted. I had to reset the Google Play Store, as the app refused to update, got stuck pending, or the store would just crash. It took over 30 minutes to fix, before I could play and make my progress back.

I made lots of progress today, screenshots are a difficult factor on gameplay, as the game will pause for 3 seconds after each screenshot during the running phase. Upon quitting, I made it to level 7, and had a high score of 106,380, with 240 rings, 26 red star rings, and 1 diamond. I eventually finished up and went to bed. This will be a daily thing. I also plan to focus on other old games. - 2023, Thursday, May 18th

## Screenshots

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the screenshots section</b><p></summary>

Screenshots are a difficult factor on gameplay, as the game will pause for 3 seconds after each screenshot during the running phase.

I now plan to split this series into monthly repositories, similar to how I documented Tree World before it got corrupted. I hope to completely finish this game this time, and not deal with corruption.

## Advertisements

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the advertisements section</b><p></summary>

Unlike other games I have played, this game has ads from multiple providers. I would have avoided them altogether, but unfortunately, they seem to be required to progress in the game. I am getting a lot of bad advertisements, more than I normally get. I am surprised by how badly unregulated it is, and how it is just getting worse over the years.

Also, if it wasn't obvious already, targeted advertising does not seem to work at all, at least for me.
